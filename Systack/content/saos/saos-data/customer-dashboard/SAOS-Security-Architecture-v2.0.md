## 1. Network Security

### 1.1 Tailscale Mesh VPN
- All SAOS services accessible only via Tailscale encrypted tunnel
- WireGuard protocol — no public internet exposure
- Device-level authentication (device keys, not just passwords)
- No open ports on public interfaces

### 1.2 CORS Policy
- Restricted to: `localhost:8768`, `*.ts.net`, `systack.net`
- No wildcard CORS origins
- Preflight requests enforced

### 1.3 Internal API Security
- Internal endpoints require `X-Internal-Api-Key` header
- Key stored in environment variable `SAOS_INTERNAL_API_KEY`
- Internal endpoints not exposed outside Tailscale

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 PIN Authentication
- 4-10 digit numeric PIN
- Stored in database with comparison hashing
- Rate limited: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per IP
- Temporary PINs for onboarding (24-hour expiry)
- PIN change revokes all active sessions

### 2.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) — P1
- TOTP RFC 6238 compliant (HMAC-SHA1, 6 digits, 30s period)
- 8 one-time recovery codes (hex format)
- Compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password
- Endpoints: setup, verify, disable, status
- MFA code required at login when enabled
- Recovery codes consumed on use

### 2.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — P1

| Role | Dashboard | Tasks | Chat | Billing | Admin | Users | All Clients |
|------|-----------|-------|------|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| customer | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| support | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| billing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ops | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

- `require_role()` decorator for endpoint protection
- `require_permission()` decorator for granular access
- All access denials logged to audit_log + security_events

### 2.4 Session Management
- Bearer token authentication
- Tokens: `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` — 32 bytes of entropy
- Token hash: SHA-256
- Expiry: 30 days
- Revocation: on logout, PIN change, or admin action
- One token per session (no session sharing)

### 2.5 Rate Limiting — P1

| Endpoint Type | Max | Window | Headers |
|---------------|-----|--------|---------|
| login | 5 | 5 min | Retry-After, X-RateLimit-* |
| mfa_verify | 5 | 5 min | Retry-After, X-RateLimit-* |
| pin_reset | 3 | 1 hour | Retry-After, X-RateLimit-* |
| register | 5 | 1 hour | Retry-After, X-RateLimit-* |
| api_general | 100 | 1 min | X-RateLimit-* |
| api_write | 30 | 1 min | X-RateLimit-* |
| webhook | 200 | 1 min | — |
| file_upload | 10 | 1 min | — |

## 3. Backup & Recovery — P2

### 3.1 Backup Strategy
- **Type:** pg_dump (full database export)
- **Frequency:** Daily (manual or via script)
- **Location:** `~/saos-backups/` (local, encrypted filesystem)
- **Format:** SQL (plain text, human-readable)
- **Retention:** 30 days rolling

### 3.2 Restore Verification
- Script: `scripts/backup_verify.py`
- Process:
  1. pg_dump → backup file
  2. SHA-256 checksum calculation
  3. Create temporary test database
  4. Restore backup to test DB
  5. Run verification queries (table existence, record counts)
  6. Drop test database
  7. Log results to `backup_log` table

### 3.3 Recovery Objectives

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| RPO (Recovery Point Objective) | 24 hours | 24 hours (daily backup) |
| RTO (Recovery Time Objective) | 10 minutes | ~3 minutes (verified) |

### 3.4 Backup Log Table
- All backup operations logged to `backup_log` table
- Tracks: type, status, file path, size, checksum, verification result, RPO/RTO
- Queryable via `/api/admin/backup-log`
