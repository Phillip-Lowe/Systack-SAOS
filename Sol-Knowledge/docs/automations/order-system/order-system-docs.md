## 8. Known Issues

1. **ES6 spread not supported in n8n Code nodes** — use explicit property copying
2. **Logo path** — must use `../images/logo.png` from subdirectory
3. **Webhook order** — must process → email → THEN respond to customer

---

## Appendix: Quick Reference

```
START:     Verify Square credentials + n8n workflow active
STOP:      Disable n8n webhook (orders rejected)
CHECK:     Google Sheet for latest orders
FIX:       If payments fail → check Square API status
ESCALATE:  If orders not logging → check n8n execution log
```
